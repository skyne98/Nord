# Nord
A very short draft of planned features:
* C#, Rust and Dart inspired syntax
* Arbitrary number of platforms and environments supported by the language itself
* [*?*] WebAssembly as a universal intermediate representation
* Global type inference
* Multiple inheritance using "imports" and "exports"
